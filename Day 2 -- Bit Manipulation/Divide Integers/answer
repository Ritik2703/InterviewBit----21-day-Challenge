##HInt--

Think in terms of bits.

How do you do the division with bits?

How do you determine the most significant bit in the answer?
Iterate on the bit position ‘i’ from 31 to 1 and find the first bit for which divisor«i is less than dividend.

How do you use (1) to move forward in similar fashion?

##sol--

int Solution::divide(int a, int b) {
     long long n = a, m = b;
   int sign = n < 0 ^ m < 0 ? -1 :1;
   long long q = 0;
   n = abs(n);
   m = abs(m);
   for (long long t = 0, i = 31; i >= 0; i--)
        if (t + (m << i) <= n)
            t += m << i, q |= 1LL << i;

    // assign back the sign
    if (sign < 0) q = -q;

    // check for overflow and return
    return q >= INT_MAX || q < INT_MIN ? INT_MAX : q;
}
