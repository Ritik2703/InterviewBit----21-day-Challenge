Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

Some value can be transferred from one element to the other. Every time x is transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) B percent of it is lost.
That is, if x was transferred from one element to the other, value of first one decreased by x units and in other increased by x -
(x * B)/100.

Your task is to make all elements of A equal by these transfers.Find what can be the maximum integral value of each element after the transfers.

Note: If maximum possible value is 2.6 return its integral part i.e. 2.



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
Output Format

Find and return what can be the maximum integral value of each element after the transfers.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 1000
0 <= B <= 99
For Example

Input 1:
    A = [4, 2, 1]
    B = 50
Output 1:
    2
Explanation:
    Transfer x = 2 from A[1] to A[3] 

Input 2:
    A = [1, 11]
    B = 90
Output 2:
    1
