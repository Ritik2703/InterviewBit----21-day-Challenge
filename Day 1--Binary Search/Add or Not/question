Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

In a single operation, any one element of array can be increased by 1. You are allowed to do atmost B such operations.

Find the number with maximum number of occurrences and return an array C of size 2, where C[0] is number of occurence and C[1] is the number with maximum occurence. If there are several such numbers, your task is to find the minimum one.



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
Output Format

Return an array C of size 2, where C[0] is number of occurence and C[1] is the number with maximum occurence.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
0 <= B <= 10^9
For Example

Input 1:
    A = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1]
    B = 3
Output 1:
    C = [4, 2]
Explanation:

    Apply operations on A[2] and A[4]
    A = [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    Maximum occurence =  4
    Minimum value of element with maximum occurence = 2

Input 2:
    A = [5, 5, 5]
    B = 3
Output 2:
    C = [3, 5]
