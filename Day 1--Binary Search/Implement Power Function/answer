#hint--

There are two major things to note here:

1) Overflow situation: Note that if x is large enough, multiplying x to the answer might overflow in integer.

2) Multiplying x one by one to the answer is O(n). We are looking for something better than O(n).

If n is even, note the following:

x ^ n = (x * x) ^ n/2

Can you use the above observation to come up with a solution better than O(n)?

#Solution--

int Solution::pow(int x, int n, int d) {
    if(n==1)
    {
        if(x<0)
        return (x%d)+d;
        return x;
    }
    if(n==0 && x==0)
    return 0;
    if(n==0)
    return 1%d;
    long long temp = pow(x,n/2,d)%d;
    long long mul = (temp * temp)%d;
    if(mul<0)
    mul = mul + d;
    if(n%2==0)
    return mul;
    return (mul*x)%d;
}
